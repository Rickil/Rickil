🚀 Key Projects
---------------

*   **[ Lidar-Hyperspectrale-Image-segmentation](https://github.com/Rickil/pixelClassifier_dataFusionContest)**: A project from the IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest 2013 for segmenting an image using hyperspectral and LiDAR data with partial groundtruth ​[](https://github.com/Rickil/pixelClassifier_dataFusionContest).
*   **[French national library project](https://github.com/Rickil/pfeeApp)**: A state of the art and benchmark of the existing object detection models to extract features from historical documents (drawings, writings, stamps, prints, photographs)​. This project was done in collaboration with the French National Library.
*   **[3D Brain MRI Segmentaion & kaggle competition](https://github.com/Rickil/keras_deep-learning)**
    
    *   _Brain MRI Segmentation_: Segmenting brain structures in infant MR images using a UNet architecture​[](https://github.com/Rickil/keras_deep-learning)​.
    *   _Ship Classification with CNN_: Classifying ships using a custom Convolutional Neural N​etwork[](https://github.com/Rickil/keras_deep-learning).
*   **[CUDA Project](https://github.com/Rickil/CUDA_project)**: Implementing a real-time GPU-based solution to correct image corruption and enhance color through histogram equalization​[](https://github.com/Rickil/CUDA_project)​.
    
*   **[Raytracing](https://github.com/Rickil/RayTracer)**: A C++ project to create images of 3D scenes using raytracing or raymarching​[](https://github.com/Rickil/RayTracer)​.
    
*   **[OpenGL Fire Scene with Raytracer](https://github.com/Rickil/POGL)**: Simulating a fire scene using raytracing in ​OpenGL[](https://github.com/Rickil/POGL).

*   **[Job Application Portal](https://github.com/Rickil/JobApplicationPortal)**: A web app for posting job offers, managing applications, and matching resumes to job descriptions using NLP and sentiment analysis[](https://github.com/Rickil/JobApplicationPortal).

* **[MiniSklearn](https://github.com/Rickil/MiniSklearn)**: MiniSklearn is a project where I implemented core machine learning models — including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, KMeans, and MLP — using only NumPy. It's a way to put theory into practice by building everything from the ground up: gradient descent, impurity metrics, backpropagation, and more — no external ML libraries involved.[](https://github.com/Rickil/MiniSklearn).

* **[Papers_Implementation](https://github.com/Rickil/papers_implementation)**: This repository contains faithful and clean implementations of influential deep learning research papers. The goal is to reproduce PyTorch implementations that strictly follow the original papers[](https://github.com/Rickil/papers_implementation).
