ðŸš€ Key Projects
---------------

*   **[ Lidar-Hyperspectrale-Image-segmentation](https://github.com/Rickil/pixelClassifier_dataFusionContest)**: A project from the IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest 2013 for segmenting an image using hyperspectral and LiDAR data with partial groundtruth â€‹[](https://github.com/Rickil/pixelClassifier_dataFusionContest).
*   **[French national library project](https://github.com/Rickil/pfeeApp)**: A state of the art and benchmark of the existing object detection models to extract features from historical documents (drawings, writings, stamps, prints, photographs)â€‹. This project was done in collaboration with the French National Library.
*   **[3D Brain MRI Segmentaion & kaggle competition](https://github.com/Rickil/keras_deep-learning)**
    
    *   _Brain MRI Segmentation_: Segmenting brain structures in infant MR images using a UNet architectureâ€‹[](https://github.com/Rickil/keras_deep-learning)â€‹.
    *   _Ship Classification with CNN_: Classifying ships using a custom Convolutional Neural Nâ€‹etwork[](https://github.com/Rickil/keras_deep-learning).
*   **[CUDA Project](https://github.com/Rickil/CUDA_project)**: Implementing a real-time GPU-based solution to correct image corruption and enhance color through histogram equalizationâ€‹[](https://github.com/Rickil/CUDA_project)â€‹.
    
*   **[Raytracing](https://github.com/Rickil/RayTracer)**: A C++ project to create images of 3D scenes using raytracing or raymarchingâ€‹[](https://github.com/Rickil/RayTracer)â€‹.
    
*   **[OpenGL Fire Scene with Raytracer](https://github.com/Rickil/POGL)**: Simulating a fire scene using raytracing in â€‹OpenGL[](https://github.com/Rickil/POGL).

*   **[Job Application Portal](https://github.com/Rickil/JobApplicationPortal)**: A web app for posting job offers, managing applications, and matching resumes to job descriptions using NLP and sentiment analysis[](https://github.com/Rickil/JobApplicationPortal).

* **[MiniSklearn](https://github.com/Rickil/MiniSklearn)**: MiniSklearn is a project where I implemented core machine learning models â€” including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, KMeans, and MLP â€” using only NumPy. It's a way to put theory into practice by building everything from the ground up: gradient descent, impurity metrics, backpropagation, and more â€” no external ML libraries involved.[](https://github.com/Rickil/MiniSklearn).

* **[Papers_Implementation](https://github.com/Rickil/papers_implementation)**: This repository contains faithful and clean implementations of influential deep learning research papers. The goal is to reproduce PyTorch implementations that strictly follow the original papers[](https://github.com/Rickil/papers_implementation).

* **[42sh](https://github.com/Rickil/42sh)**: A custom Unix shell built from scratch in C, supporting input parsing, scripting, file redirection, and command execution, with a modular and testable design[](https://github.com/Rickil/42sh).

* **[OPIChat](https://github.com/Rickil/opichat)**: A lightweight IRC-inspired chat application in C featuring a custom client/server architecture using sockets and epoll for concurrent connection handling[](https://github.com/Rickil/opichat).
* **[MyIDE](https://github.com/Rickil/PING-IDE)**: MyIDE is an integrated development environment that provides a modern, feature-rich coding experience. It combines a Java backend with a JavaScript/HTML frontend to create a versatile IDE that supports multiple programming languages including Java and C++[](https://github.com/Rickil/PING-IDE).
